# Elsevier has a 37% profit margin.

Apple at its peak had 27%.

## FAIR Data

- Findable – making research outputs discoverable by the wider academic community and the public,
- Accessible – using unique identifiers, metadata and a clear use of language and access protocols,
- Interoperable – applying standards to encode and exchange data and metadata and...
- Reusable – enabling the repurposing of research outputs to maximise their research potential.


## Reproducibility

Studies funded by the OSF found only 50% of findings replicate

#### Reasons

- Bad research design
- HARKing, p-hacking

#### Problems

- Lack of analysis code availability
- Lack of raw data availability
- Problems with reproduction efforts


## What is reproducibility? 

![](rr.png){.absolute top=50 right=50 width="200" height="200"}

#### Computational reproducibility

- access to code and data 
- Others can reproduce your results.

#### Empirical reproducibility
- sufficient information to recreate experiments or copy the study

#### Replicability
- quality of an outcome and a study
- not discussed here



## Future of Scholarly Communication

Science communication has to adapt.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Science and peer-reviewed publications should be **publicly accessible**.
- **Multiple output formats** for different types of audiences

What are **tools** that support this outcome?

## New publication formats

## Education and Skills

Researchers must learn to apply open science principles [@skillseu].


- library and information skills
- open publication literacy skills
- data management and open data skills
- data science skills
- etc.

# Why do open science?

## Why do open science?

#### Value-based reasons 

- increases rigour, accountability, and reproducibility
- based on inclusion, fairness, equity, and sharing
- We get paid by the public, our results should be public



## Why do open science?

#### Benefits of open science

![](figures/citation_advantage.jpeg){.absolute top=250 right=-150 width="600" height="500"}

- Open research gets more attention [@piwowar2013data]
  - easier to cite
  - easier for others to work with
  - easier for collaborators

. . .

Easier **for you** to follow up.



# Making your research open is a lot of work

# How to do open science?





# Literate Programming 

Programming "mixed" with explanations (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, RMarkdown, Quarto). 

## Quarto 

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.
It allows creating dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.

. . .

This presentation was created in Quarto.

. . .

It is available live:
 - as a website: https://osiluebeck23.netlify.app/
 - as source code: 

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

# Quarto

## Quarto has column support

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
contents...
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
contents...
:::

::::


## Showing code

```{r}
1+2
```

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
