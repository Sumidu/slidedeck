## Zielpublikum identifizieren

### Wir kennen und verstehen unsere Datenattribute und Messniveaus

- Categorical 
- Ordered 
- Quantitative

**Ziel: Wir wollen die effektivste Visualisierung wählen**

## Channels und Marks Theorie


- Channels: 
  - Position
  - Farbe 
  - Form
- Marks: 
 - Punkte 
 - Linien 
 - Flächen
 
 Channels entsprechen Ästhetiken und Marks entsprechen Geomen in der ggplot-Welt

**Wie wählt man Channels und Marks basierend auf Datenattributen und Aufgabe?**
